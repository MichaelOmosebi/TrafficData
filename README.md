# TrafficData
This repository comprises two projects. In summary it shoes code on how to get traffic data from a Map-App, and then analyse the traffic data to test some hypothesis about patterns.

Precisely, I will be fetching the travel distance and duration of selected central locations in Lagos state in an attempt to determine which day is busiest in Lagos state. For this project, BingMaps will be used.
