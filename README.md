# TrafficData
This repository comprises two projects. In summary it shoes code on how to get traffic data of Selected locations from a Map-App (BingMaps), and then analyse the traffic data to test some hypothesis about patterns.

Precisely, I will be fetching the travel distance and duration of selected central locations in Lagos state in an attempt to determine which day is busiest in Lagos state.
